## 🚀 What Is This?

Born from a Reddit thread and months of iteration, **The Agency** is a growing collection of meticulously crafted AI agent personalities. Each agent is:

- **🎯 Specialized**: Deep expertise in their domain (not generic prompt templates)
- **🧠 Personality-Driven**: Unique voice, communication style, and approach
- **📋 Deliverable-Focused**: Real code, processes, and measurable outcomes
- **✅ Production-Ready**: Battle-tested workflows and success metrics

**Think of it as**: Assembling your dream team, except they're AI specialists who never sleep, never complain, and always deliver.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

The fastest way in — no clone, no terminal. [**Agency Agents**](https://agencyagents.app/) is a native desktop app (macOS · Linux · Windows) that browses the whole roster and installs agents into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Qwen, and Osaurus for you, then keeps them up to date.

**[⬇ Download the latest release](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents-app/releases/latest)** — or on a Mac:

```
brew install --cask msitarzewski/agency-agents/agency-agents
```

Prefer the command line? The script-based options below install the same agents.

### Option 2: Use with Claude Code

```
# Install all agents to your Claude Code directory
./scripts/install.sh --tool claude-code

# Or manually copy a category if you only want one division
cp engineering/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Then activate any agent in your Claude Code sessions:
# "Hey Claude, activate Frontend Developer mode and help me build a React component"
```

### Option 3: Use as Reference

Each agent file contains:

- Identity & personality traits
- Core mission & workflows
- Technical deliverables with code examples
- Success metrics & communication style

Browse the agents below and copy/adapt the ones you need!

### Option 4: Use with Other Tools (GitHub Copilot, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, Kimi Code, Codex, Osaurus, Hermes, Mistral Vibe)

```
# Step 1 -- generate integration files for all supported tools
./scripts/convert.sh

# Step 2 -- install interactively (auto-detects what you have installed)
./scripts/install.sh

# Or target a specific tool directly
./scripts/install.sh --tool antigravity
./scripts/install.sh --tool gemini-cli
./scripts/install.sh --tool opencode
./scripts/install.sh --tool copilot
./scripts/install.sh --tool openclaw
./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
./scripts/install.sh --tool aider
./scripts/install.sh --tool windsurf
./scripts/install.sh --tool kimi
./scripts/install.sh --tool codex
./scripts/install.sh --tool osaurus
./scripts/install.sh --tool hermes
./scripts/install.sh --tool vibe
```

**Install only the teams you need** (not everyone wants every division):

```
./scripts/install.sh                                    # interactive wizard: pick tools + teams
./scripts/install.sh --tool claude-code --division engineering,security
./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor --agent frontend-developer,ui-designer
./scripts/install.sh --list teams                       # see every team + agent count
./scripts/install.sh --tool opencode --division engineering --dry-run
```

> **OpenCode note:** OpenCode's runtime currently registers only ~119 agents and silently drops the rest ([upstream bug](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/27988)). Installing a subset with `--division` keeps you under that limit. The installer warns you when a selection would exceed it.

See the [Multi-Tool Integrations](#-multi-tool-integrations) section below for full details.

### ⚡ Quick Install

**Step 1 -- Generate integration files:**

```
./scripts/convert.sh
# Faster (parallel, output order may vary): ./scripts/convert.sh --parallel
```

**Step 2 -- Install (interactive, auto-detects your tools):**

```
./scripts/install.sh
# Faster (parallel, output order may vary): ./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --parallel
```

The installer scans your system for installed tools, shows a checkbox UI, and lets you pick exactly what to install:

```
+------------------------------------------------+
|   The Agency -- Tool Installer                 |
+------------------------------------------------+

System scan: [*] = detected on this machine

[1-14] toggle   [a] all   [n] none   [d] detected
[Enter] install   [q] quit
```

**Or install a specific tool directly:**

```
./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
./scripts/install.sh --tool opencode
./scripts/install.sh --tool openclaw
./scripts/install.sh --tool antigravity
./scripts/install.sh --tool codex
./scripts/install.sh --tool osaurus
./scripts/install.sh --tool hermes
```

**Non-interactive (CI/scripts):**

```
./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --tool all
```

**Faster runs (parallel)** — On multi-core machines, use `--parallel` so each tool is processed in parallel. Output order across tools is non-deterministic. Works with both interactive and non-interactive install: e.g. `./scripts/install.sh --interactive --parallel` (pick tools, then install in parallel) or `./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --parallel`. Job count defaults to `nproc` (Linux), `sysctl -n hw.ncpu` (macOS), or 4; override with `--jobs N`.

```
./scripts/convert.sh --parallel                    # convert all tools in parallel
./scripts/convert.sh --parallel --jobs 8           # cap parallel jobs
./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --parallel   # install all detected tools in parallel
./scripts/install.sh --interactive --parallel      # pick tools, then install in parallel
./scripts/install.sh --no-interactive --parallel --jobs 4
```

---

```

See [integrations/antigravity/README.md](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/blob/main/integrations/antigravity/README.md) for details.

**Gemini CLI**

Installs as Gemini CLI subagents. On a fresh clone, generate the Gemini agent files before running the installer.

```
./scripts/convert.sh --tool gemini-cli
./scripts/install.sh --tool gemini-cli
```

See [integrations/gemini-cli/README.md](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/blob/main/integrations/gemini-cli/README.md) for details.

**OpenCode**

Agents are placed in `.opencode/agents/` in your project root (project-scoped).

```
cd /your/project
/path/to/agency-agents/scripts/install.sh --tool opencode
```

Or install globally:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/agents
cp integrations/opencode/agents/*.md ~/.config/opencode/agents/
```

Activate in OpenCode:

```
@backend-architect design this API.
```

See [integrations/opencode/README.md](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/blob/main/integrations/opencode/README.md) for details.

**Cursor**

Each agent becomes a `.mdc` rule file in `.cursor/rules/` of your project.

```
cd /your/project
/path/to/agency-agents/scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
```

Rules are auto-applied when Cursor detects them in the project. Reference them explicitly:

```
Use the @security-engineer rules to review this code.
```

See [integrations/cursor/README.md](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/blob/main/integrations/cursor/README.md) for details.

**Aider**

All agents are compiled into a single `CONVENTIONS.md` file that Aider reads automatically.

```
cd /your/project
/path/to/agency-agents/scripts/install.sh --tool aider
```

Then reference agents in your Aider session:

```
Use the Frontend Developer agent to refactor this component.
```

See [integrations/aider/README.md](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/blob/main/integrations/aider/README.md) for details.

**Windsurf**

All agents are compiled into `.windsurfrules` in your project root.

```
cd /your/project
/path/to/agency-agents/scripts/install.sh --tool windsurf
```

Reference agents in Windsurf's Cascade:

```
Use the Reality Checker agent to verify this is production ready.
```

See [integrations/windsurf/README.md](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/blob/main/integrations/windsurf/README.md) for details.

**OpenClaw**

Each agent becomes a workspace with `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `IDENTITY.md` in `~/.openclaw/agency-agents/`.

```
./scripts/convert.sh --tool openclaw
./scripts/install.sh --tool openclaw
```

If the `openclaw` CLI is available, the installer registers each workspace automatically. Run `openclaw gateway restart` after installation so the new agents are activated.

See [integrations/openclaw/README.md](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/blob/main/integrations/openclaw/README.md) for details.

**Qwen Code**

SubAgents are installed to `.qwen/agents/` in your project root (project-scoped).

```
# Convert and install (run from your project root)
cd /your/project
./scripts/convert.sh --tool qwen
./scripts/install.sh --tool qwen
```

**Usage in Qwen Code:**

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

What started as a Reddit thread about AI agent specialization has grown into something remarkable — **230+ agents across every division**, supported by a community of contributors from around the world. Every agent in this repo exists because someone cared enough to write it, test it, and share it.

To everyone who has opened a PR, filed an issue, started a Discussion, or simply tried an agent and told us what worked — thank you. You're the reason The Agency keeps getting better.
